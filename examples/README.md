# Runnable MODL examples

Every path below is an ordinary project accepted by `mod01 check`, `run`, `test`, `pack`, and
Studio import. They use only public MODL/1 and Hardware Revision 1 interfaces.

Start with `mod01 run examples/api-tour`, then inspect both source modules and
`tests/smoke.modl`. `mod01 test examples/api-tour` runs its pure assertion and deterministic
scripted-frame example. The `templates/` directory contains deliberately small blank, arcade,
platform, grid/roguelike, and four-player starting points; they are examples, not a hidden engine.
